# This file contains the order and numbering for all sections in the book.
#
# It is a sample TOC file to help you get started. Fill it out with entries
# for your own content.
#
# Each entry has the following schema:
#
# - title: mytitle   # Title of chapter or section
#   url: /myurl  # URL of section relative to the /content/ folder.
#   sections:  # Contains a list of more entries that make up the chapter's sections
#   not_numbered: true  # if the section shouldn't have a number in the sidebar
#     (e.g. Introduction or appendices)
#   expand_sections: true  # if you'd like the sections of this chapter to always
#     be expanded in the sidebar.
#   external: true  # Whether the URL is an external link or points to content in the book
#
# Below are some special values that trigger specific behavior:
# - search: true  # Will provide a link to a search page
# - divider: true  # Will insert a divider in the sidebar
# - header: My Header  # Will insert a header with no link in the sidebar
#
# See the links below for an example.
